# SLM Text Summarization Script
This script provides a simple tool for summarizing long texts using the Small Language Modeling (SLM) technique. It leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques to generate concise summaries while preserving key information from the original text.

# Installation
1. Install Python (if not already installed) from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

2. Install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install nltk

3. Download NLTK resources by running the following commands:
python -m nltk.downloader punkt
python -m nltk.downloader stopwords

## Usage
1. Clone the repository or download the Python script (slm_text_summarization.py) to your local machine.

2. Open the Python script in your preferred text editor or integrated development environment (IDE) such as Visual Studio Code.

3. Replace the placeholder text in the text variable with your own long text or article that you want to summarize.

4. Run the Python script.
python slm_text_summarization.py

## Example
text = """
    Your long text or article goes here. This is just a placeholder example. 
    You can replace it with your own text to test the summarization tool.
"""

summary = summarize_text(text)
print("Summary:")
print(summary)

## Acknowledgments
The script uses NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) for text processing.
